## Generating a PDF (via Overleaf)

If you want to generate a professional PDF version of your résumé using LaTeX, you can use the linked Overleaf project.

### Steps:

- Open your Overleaf project:
https://www.overleaf.com/

- Upload or edit the .tex résumé template inside Overleaf.

- Click Recompile to generate the PDF.

- Download the PDF directly from Overleaf using the Download PDF button.

Note: Overleaf compiles LaTeX files, so if your HTML résumé is different, you may need to manually migrate the content into the LaTeX template provided in the project.
